- **LAB 1**
  - I really like lab one because of its simple nature making it easy for me to understand. I also really like how it opened me to the world of coding. Through the lab, I had some challenges, but it forced me to learn and memorize the coding language which ended up helping in the long run.

-**LAB 3** 
  - I really like lab three because of the appearance of makefiles. Makefiles made the lab more interesting and new, showing me my overall grade and how my code works. This lab really got me thinking on how makefiles were created and what its code looks like. 

-**LAB 12** 
  - I really thought lab twelve was fun based on how we created a gif file. Lab twelve was really challenging but my partner and I powered through it and finished it in two days. This lab is my favorite because after we finished i copied it and created a happy mother day gif and showed it to my mom.
